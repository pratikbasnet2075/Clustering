k-Means Clustering

This repository involve implementing the k-Means Clustering algorithm for clustering tasks. Use Euclidean distance to assign points to clusters and update centroids. Initialize centroids randomly and run the algorithm until convergence or for a maximum of 100 iterations.

k-Means Clustering for 2 Features with k=2 Clusters
Implement the k-Means Clustering algorithm to cluster a dataset with two features (e.g., x-coordinate, y-coordinate) into two clusters. Input: Dataset (provided below), number of clusters k=2. Output: Cluster assignments for each data point and final centroid positions. Requirement: Implement the algorithm and test it on the provided dataset. Compute the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) to evaluate clustering quality. Include a visualization of the clusters using a scatter plot, with data points color-coded by cluster and centroids marked.

2.k-Means Clustering for Arbitrary Features with k Clusters

Implement the k-Means Clustering algorithm to cluster a dataset with an arbitrary number of features into k clusters. Generalize the implementation to handle any number of features and clusters. Input: Dataset (provided below), number of clusters k (e.g., k=3). Output: Cluster assignments for each data point and final centroid positions. Requirement: Implement the algorithm and test it on the provided dataset with k=3. Compute the within-cluster sum of squares. For visualization, if the dataset has more than two features, project the data onto the first two features (e.g., using PCA or selecting the first two features) and display a scatter plot with clusters and centroids.
